Description=One of the greatest generals in the history of the Council, Solomon Ghaffar once served as Darius Javidan's right-hand man and his military prowess is legendary.  When Darius's death precipitated the Great Cataclysm, Solomon was the first to mobilize the military for the fight against the Ceyah.  His youthful appearance belies his almost encyclopedic knowledge of military tactics and strategy.  It was Solomon who led the search for the treacherous Vashti, and it was Solomon who led the armies of the Council against the Ceyah throughout the Second Age.  He was slain by the bow of Melchior late in the Second Age, but his amulet was spirited away and he was reawakened almost immediately.  He has been a tireless warrior since, tasting defeat only rarely, and influencing generations of Mareten with his leadership and chivalry.
