Description = Karg has always been one to lead from the front. His excellent leadership skills, and ability to almost prophetically predict what his enemies will do, has enabled him to become the Drauga's most capable General.  Though fearsome in battle, Karg is able to keep his blood-rage in check enough to allow his strategic mind to calculate and command what needs to be done to win the battlefield.  Since he has never lost a battle in his time serving as Great-General of the Drauga forces, it has become rumored that he can see the future in the fires of war.
