Description=Marrok was among the first Kohan to rise up against the Ceyah during the first Cataclysm.  His strength and prowess in battle were equaled only by his genius as a tactician.  He helped stem the tide of darkness brought forth by Ahriman's forces, but at great cost.  His amulet was captured by Typhon during the chaos of the Last Battle, and Marrok was turned to the Shadow in a ritual by Ahriman himself, where Marrok was marked eternally as the Shadow's Hunter, given his Dark Wolf form, and imbued with speed and great defense.
