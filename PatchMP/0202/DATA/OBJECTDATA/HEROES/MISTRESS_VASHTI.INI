Description = Widely regarded as one of the most skilled warriors in all of Khaldun, Jhorin loves nothing more than a good fight. Though he is the eldest of his house, Jhorin passed the mantle of house head to his brother Ghalen in order to devote more time to dueling and perfecting his skill sword or axe.  It is said that he is the only one to have ever bested Darius Javidan in single combat, though he is too honorable and too respectful of his friend Darius to ever acknowledge the feat publicly. In battle, Jhorin is always found where the fight is thickest and bloodiest, often wading through a sea of enemies with his battle axe, Dawn's Edge.   He believes true peace can only be achieved through victory on the battlefield, and has dedicated himself to always being on the frontlines in the war against the Shadow.
