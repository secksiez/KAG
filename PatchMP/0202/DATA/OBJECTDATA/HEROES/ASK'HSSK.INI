Description 		= 	Not long after the Creation, the Saadya Akaliyah noticed an imbalance in the flow of aja, the manifestation of the Creator's power on Khaldun.  Knowing that it was Ahriman who had channeled the aja into the creation of the world, Akaliyah sought his counsel, but Ahriman refused to acknowledge that a problem existed.  Akaliyah sought to ensure that the flows of aja would continue unabated, for if they were interrupted the results would be disastrous for all living things.  She transformed a gravid giant turtle, naming it a Slaanri and bestowing upon it intelligence and a gentleness of being.  She attuned this Slaanri, named Ask'Hssk, to the flow of aja, giving her an innate harmony with the world of Khaldun.  Naming her the First Mystic, she set upon her and her descendents the task of guarding the flow of aja.  From Ask'Hssk all other Slaanri sprung.
