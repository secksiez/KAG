Description=Surrak Aswan is one of the greatest and most respected generals of the Haroun Nation. Unquestionably the most skilled Rune Priest of the Jo'Hanai, he employs the ancient art of glyph magic to aid him in battle with the Shadow.  He has dedicated his life to eradicating any element of the shadow and is often seen traveling from Haroun village to Haroun village on his massive mount Windscar to maintain the wards set to protect his people from the ire of the Dark One.  As deadly as he is wise, his indomitable will to oppose the tide of evil has made him an invaluable asset for the forces of Light.
