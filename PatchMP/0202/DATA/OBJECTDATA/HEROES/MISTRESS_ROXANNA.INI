Description = Nyk'Srss intensely pursues a personal quest known only to himself, seeking out ancient ruins in search of lost knowledge of dragon lore and healing arts.  From his findings in dusty records, he has also crafted mystical arts that can bend the battlefield and even affect the movement of archers' arrows.  He is cold toward his allies, but even colder toward anyone in the Ceyah cause, a hatred which has led him to join the Nationalist faction.
