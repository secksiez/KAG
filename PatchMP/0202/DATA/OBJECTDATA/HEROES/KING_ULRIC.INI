Description = King Ulric embodies the dualistic northmen traits of savagery and honor.  A great-chieftain of the seven tribes of the Plains of Khalyr, he is a legend among his people as well as his enemies for being a devious tactician.  Even before his ascension to the throne he was well-known for slaying a great serpent in the Sea of Storms with his bright sword, Skipper, and for destroying the Dragon Overlord Shaggoth in single combat, thus earning the title "Ulric the Slayer".  For years he has dominated the plains of Khalyr, killing countless would-be challengers.  Fearsome in battle, he was once equally amiable in peace, until the day all three of his sons died when an assault on the Ceyah town of Babel-xasr led by Ruarc Varagoth was routed by a Ceyah ambush, and the Kohan could not decide on a path of retreat wide enough for his mount Yshai.  Ulric also bears a deep hatred for Kendra Langston and Dali Azade, who both declined to lead the assault for what he thinks were frivolous reasons.
