Description=An intuitive fighter, tactician, and strategist, Sigrid Maesun is one of the greatest unsung heroes in Khaldun history.  He played a pivotal role in defeating the demonic invasion during the War of the Shadow, where he destroyed countless scores of demons and shadowspawn, even temporarily routing Typhon’s forces from the field.  In battle, he has an uncanny knack for positioning each element of his army to counter the tactical strength of his enemies.  Many battles were won through Sigrid's might alone.  Unlike his bretheren, the elite breed of Disciple warriors, Sigrid was gifted with the ability to foresee future events to come.  Sigrid’s strength coupled with his powerful far-seeing visions enables him to prepare those around him to be victorious.
