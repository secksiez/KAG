Description=Awakened by Ahriman himself, Typhon is the personification of death and destruction.  The blood of thousands of Immortals stain the hands of this ruthless and cunning Daemon-spawn.  His arrival on the battlefield during the First Cataclysm struck fear into the hearts of his enemies and heralded much bloodshed.  Only the strongest Kohan dared face him in combat.  Even before his ascension as Lord of Destruction, he bested countless unspeakable horrors in the Void, cultivating an immense strength, will, and devious wit and thus earning the favor of the Dark Lord.  Slayer of Souls, Butcher of Immortals, Typhon desires nothing more than to see the Kohan destroyed from this world.
