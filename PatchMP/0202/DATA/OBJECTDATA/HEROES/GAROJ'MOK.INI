Description 		= Strybjorn is one who invariably solves the problems that come his way with swift and bloody acts of violence. It is said that to witness one of his berserk rages is to watch the murderous fury of the hurricane come to life. Strybjorn's rage is matched equally by his skill, and even in his furious assaults upon his foes, every blade cut, or hack, displays a brutal precision unequaled by any other warrior. Indeed, Strybjorn's ferocity in battle is as infectious as it is legendary, his primal fury inspiring his troops to fight all the harder in his presence.
