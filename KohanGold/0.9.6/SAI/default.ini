;       06/13/01 - IanK - Updated and reformatted; added Ahriman's Gift units
;	09/13/01 - IanK - CompanyFrontRepeatPenalty set to -5 as indicated in the comments
;	04/10/02 - IanK - Updated Default SAI Profile to improve performance of Medium and
;				Hard SAIs across the board.  The improvements are in unit
;				commissioning, bank account allocation, and goal priority
;				settings.  Also, the comments throughout the Default SAI
;				have been improved for easier comprehension
;	04/13/02 - IanK - Continued minor updates and tweaks
;	04/24/02 - IanK - Additional tweaks based on RickC's (Fenwe) feedback and internal testing
