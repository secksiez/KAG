name                    = Jur'Mogruk
description             = Jur'Mogruk is a general capable of leading any of the independent nations to victory.  While he eschews Mareten or Ceyah units, he will use them as a last resort.  He prefers to field armies replete with units from his own race and often proves a formidable opponent and a staunch (if hard won) ally.
