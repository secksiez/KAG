Description = Zerin is an enigmatic figure, solitary and aloof even by the standards of the Kohan. Those that know him understand his grim nature for what it is - an obsession with uncovering the secrets of the cataclysms that have ravaged Khaldun. Once an avid scholar and prominent member of House Mordecai during the First Age, Zerin has since isolated himself from even his own House and focused solely on his research. Many speculate his research was responsible for the introduction of the Nightbringer to Nationalist society, though his fierce loyalty to the Nationalist cause is the only thing that is known for certain. In battle, Zerin is known for his ceremonial, heavily ornamented garbs and fearsome command of shadow magic. His ability to weaponise his dark knowledge has unnerved even the most powerful of the Ceyah.
