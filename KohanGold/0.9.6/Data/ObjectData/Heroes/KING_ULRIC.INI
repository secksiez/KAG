Description                 =   As beautiful as she is deadly, Jilla Jannat thrives on conflict and debate and always seems to emerge victorious. Her raven black hair and sea-green eyes are at odds with the grim set of her lips and her aquiline nose. She eschewed the Nationalist leanings of her House and followed the path of the Council. Outwardly her actions have all supported the Council, though she has been accused of being sympathetic to the Ceyah. Outside of Council meetings Jilla keeps to herself, preferring to work in the shadows.
