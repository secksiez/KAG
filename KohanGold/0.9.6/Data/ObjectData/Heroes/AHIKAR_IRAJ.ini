Description         =   Beloved wife of Sebastian Atafeh, the comely Ahikar Iraj is a fierce warrior in her own right. Ahikar wields a bow named Del'Kostan that gets more accurate the more she uses it in battle. Ahikar is the last living member of the House Iraj, once one of the most powerful Houses in the Council. Ahikar turned from the Council and joined the Nationalist movement when her House was slain and their amulets captured by the treacherous Ceyah Kohan, Ma'ar Nasai. She has sworn vengeance against the Ceyah at any cost by whatever means necessary.
