Description                     =   One of the true Ceyah Kohan who broke from the High Council on the Day of Betrayal. Shohn Maht was a lesser council member who idolized Ceyahdev and strove to be as strong and influential as her. When Ceyahdev broke from the Council, Shohn Maht followed without hesitation. He embraced his banishment convincing himself that he was superior to the rest of the Kohan. He followed Ceyahdev for a short time, then broke away when it became apparent that she only desired isolation. Shohn Maht desired power and decided that the Mareten would make perfect subjects. He managed to survive the next cataclysm and learned as much as he could about Ahriman and his plans. He is a master of dark magic and much of his kingdom is protected with hordes of the walking dead.
