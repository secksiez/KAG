Description                 =   The Mercenary is a fast and deadly rogue infantryman who works for the highest bidder. They will maintain their own equipment and upkeep but are expensive and not known for having high morale. Their status as contractors, as well as their separate logistics, prevents them from making use of many - if any at all - of their employer's technologies. ;'
